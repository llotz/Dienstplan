## Installation of test environment

- Clone git repo
- ```docker-compose up```

## Language

The interface is _german_. I'm planning to implement a translation to english by time.

## Playing with test data

When docker-compose has done it's work you can login with **test@admin.de** and password **test** as admin or **test@user.de** and password **test** as user.
